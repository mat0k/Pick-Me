# Pick Me Up - Revolutionizing Urban Mobility in Lebanon

Pick Me Up is an Android application designed to transform the urban mobility landscape in Lebanon by connecting passengers and independent drivers through a user-friendly mobile platform. This project aims to address the challenges faced by the current transportation market in Lebanon, characterized by a significant number of freelance drivers operating without a structured and transparent system, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues.
